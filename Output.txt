I 👏 find 👏 my 👏 dad 👏 in 👏 the 👏 parking 👏 lot. 👏 He 👏 drives 👏 me 👏 back 👏 to 👏 our 👏 house 👏 and 👏 camp 👏 is 👏 over. 👏 So 👏 is 👏 summer, 👏 even 👏 though 👏 there's 👏 two 👏 weeks 👏 until 👏 school 👏 starts. 👏 This 👏 isn't 👏 a 👏 story 👏 about 👏 how 👏 girls 👏 are 👏 evil 👏 or 👏 how 👏 love 👏 is 👏 bad, 👏 this 👏 is 👏 a 👏 story 👏 about 👏 how 👏 I 👏 learned 👏 something 👏 and 👏 I'm 👏 not 👏 saying 👏 this 👏 thing 👏 is 👏 true 👏 or 👏 not, 👏 I'm 👏 just 👏 saying 👏 it's 👏 what 👏 I 👏 learned. 👏 I 👏 told 👏 you 👏 something. 👏 It 👏 was 👏 just 👏 for 👏 you 👏 and 👏 you 👏 told 👏 everybody. 👏 So 👏 I 👏 learned 👏 cut 👏 out 👏 the 👏 middle 👏 man, 👏 make 👏 it 👏 all 👏 for 👏 everybody, 👏 always. 👏 Everybody 👏 can't 👏 turn 👏 around 👏 and 👏 tell 👏 everybody, 👏 everybody 👏 already 👏 knows, 👏 I 👏 told 👏 them. 👏 But 👏 this 👏 means 👏 there 👏 isn't 👏 a 👏 place 👏 in 👏 my 👏 life 👏 for 👏 you 👏 or 👏 someone 👏 like 👏 you. 👏 Is 👏 it 👏 sad? 👏 Sure. 👏 But 👏 it's 👏 a 👏 sadness 👏 I 👏 chose. 👏 I 👏 wish 👏 I 👏 could 👏 say 👏 this 👏 was 👏 a 👏 story 👏 about 👏 how 👏 I 👏 got 👏 on 👏 the 👏 bus 👏 a 👏 boy 👏 and 👏 got 👏 off 👏 a 👏 man 👏 more 👏 cynical, 👏 hardened, 👏 and 👏 mature 👏 and 👏 shit. 👏 But 👏 that's 👏 not 👏 true. 👏 The 👏 truth 👏 is 👏 I 👏 got 👏 on 👏 the 👏 bus 👏 a 👏 boy. 👏 And 👏 I 👏 never 👏 got 👏 off 👏 the 👏 bus. 👏 I 👏 still 👏 haven't.
